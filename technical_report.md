## Abstract

This technical report presents CaNA (Context-Aware Nodule Augmentation), a approach for augmenting lung nodule segmentation masks using anatomical context from organ and body segmentation. CaNA leverages multi-label segmentation maps to ensure that modified nodules remain within realistic anatomical boundaries. Our method employs controlled morphological operations guided by lung structure labels, achieving improved volume control while maintaining anatomical plausibility. Experimental validation demonstrates robust performance with 100% successful augmentations and enhanced overshoot prevention achieving target volumes within ±10% tolerance across diverse datasets. 

**Keywords:** Medical imaging, data augmentation, lung nodules, context-aware processing, morphological operations, anatomical constraints

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Data augmentation plays a crucial role in medical imaging applications, particularly for training robust deep learning models with limited datasets. Traditional augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, and elastic deformation often fail to preserve anatomical realism, especially when applied to organ-specific structures like lung nodules.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Existing augmentation methods for lung nodule segmentation face several challenges:

1. **Anatomical Implausibility**: Standard geometric transformations may place nodules outside lung boundaries
2. **Size Constraints**: Simple scaling operations lack medical domain knowledge about realistic nodule size variations
3. **Context Ignorance**: Current methods do not consider surrounding anatomical structures
4. **Quality Control**: Limited validation mechanisms for ensuring medically reasonable outputs

### 1.3 Proposed Solution

CaNA addresses these limitations through:
- **Anatomical Constraint Integration**: Uses lung segmentation labels as spatial boundaries
- **Context-Aware Processing**: Considers surrounding organ structures during modification
- **Controlled Morphological Operations**: Applies medical domain knowledge to guide augmentation
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Provides detailed quality metrics and statistical analysis

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 System Architecture

CaNA implements a modular pipeline consisting of four primary components:

```
Input Processing → Context Analysis → Morphological Augmentation → Quality Validation
```

#### 2.1.1 Input Processing Module
- **Data Validation**: Ensures NIfTI format compliance and label consistency
- **Metadata Extraction**: Parses spacing, orientation, and anatomical information
- **Preprocessing**: Standardizes input formats and validates segmentation integrity

#### 2.1.2 Context Analysis Module
- **Lesion Detection**: Connected component analysis for individual nodule identification
- **Anatomical Mapping**: Associates each nodule with surrounding lung structures
- **Boundary Identification**: Determines valid expansion/contraction regions

#### 2.1.3 Morphological Augmentation Module
- **Controlled Dilation**: Anatomically-constrained expansion operations
- **Controlled Erosion**: Boundary-aware shrinking operations
- **Volume Targeting**: Iterative refinement to achieve precise size objectives

#### 2.1.4 Quality Validation Module
- **Volume Verification**: Confirms target size achievement within tolerance
- **Boundary Checking**: Validates anatomical constraint compliance
- **Statistical Reporting**: Generates comprehensive processing metrics

### 2.2 Mathematical Framework

#### 2.2.1 Notation

Let:
- $L$ = Input segmentation volume with multiple labels
- $N_i$ = Individual nodule mask (connected component $i$)
- $B$ = Combined lung boundary mask (labels 28-32)
- $S$ = Target scaling factor
- $\mathcal{M}_r(X)$ = Morphological operation with structuring element radius $r$

#### 2.2.2 Expansion Algorithm

For nodule expansion, the augmented mask $N'_i$ is computed as:

$$N'_i = N_i \cup \left(\bigcup_{k=1}^{K} \mathcal{D}_k(N_i) \cap B\right)$$

Where:
- $\mathcal{D}_k$ represents $k$ iterations of binary dilation
- $K$ is determined by target volume achievement
- Intersection with $B$ ensures anatomical compliance

#### 2.2.3 Shrinking Algorithm

For nodule shrinking, the process involves:

1. **Replacement**: $L[N_i] = \text{dominant\_lung\_label}(N_i)$
2. **Erosion**: $N'_i = \bigcap_{k=1}^{K} \mathcal{E}_k(N_i) \cap B$

Where $\mathcal{E}_k$ represents $k$ iterations of binary erosion.

#### 2.2.4 Volume Control (Enhanced v1.1)

Target volume $V_{\text{target}}$ is defined as:

$$V_{\text{target}} = V_{\text{original}} \times S$$

The enhanced algorithm incorporates overshoot prevention:

$$V_{\text{max}} = V_{\text{target}} \times 1.1$$

The algorithm iterates until:

$$V_{\text{target}} \leq V_{\text{current}} \leq V_{\text{max}}$$

Where the 10% tolerance prevents excessive growth while maintaining target achievement.

### 2.3 Implementation Details

#### 2.3.1 Morphological Operations

CaNA employs 3D ball-shaped structuring elements:

```python
structuring_element = ball(radius=1)  # 3×3×3 neighborhood
```

This choice ensures isotropic modification while maintaining computational efficiency.

#### 2.3.2 Anatomical Label Mapping

Standard lung segmentation labels used:
- **Label 23**: Lung nodules/lesions
- **Labels 28-32**: Various lung tissue types and boundaries
- **Background (0)**: Non-anatomical regions

#### 2.3.3 Multi-Lesion Handling

For cases with multiple nodules:

1. **Independent Processing**: Each connected component processed separately
2. **Context Preservation**: Neighboring nodules maintain relative spatial relationships
3. **Label Consistency**: Dominant lung label determined per nodule via majority voting

## 6. Discussion

### 6.1 Technical Advantages (v1.1 Enhanced)

#### 6.1.1 Anatomical Constraint Integration

CaNA's primary innovation lies in leveraging anatomical context during augmentation. By using lung segmentation labels as spatial constraints, the method ensures that modified nodules remain within realistic anatomical boundaries, addressing a critical limitation of traditional augmentation approaches.

#### 6.1.2 Enhanced Controlled Morphological Processing

The v1.1 iterative morphological approach includes significant improvements:
